**Implementation**: Complete

## What We Built (60-Second Overview)

Your Petal Dome website now **automatically changes the main image and message** based on upcoming holidays and events. No manual updates needed.

---

## The Problem We Solved

**Before:**
- Manual website updates for each holiday
- Risk of outdated content (Christmas images in February)
- Time-consuming maintenance
- Easy to forget important dates

**After:**
- ✅ Automatic updates based on calendar
- ✅ Always shows relevant seasonal content
- ✅ Zero maintenance required
- ✅ Increases sales with timely marketing

---

## How It Works (Simple)

```
Customer visits website → System checks today's date
→ Finds next upcoming event → Shows that event's image + message
```

**Example:**
- **Jan 1-23**: Shows generic birthday/anniversary content
- **Jan 24-Feb 14**: Automatically shows Valentine's Day content ❤️
- **Feb 15+**: Automatically switches to next event (Easter/Spring)
