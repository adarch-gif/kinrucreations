## My Recommendation

**Start with Option 2** (Carousel + Gallery) because:
1. Professional appearance
2. Immediate visual variety
3. Not too complex to maintain
4. Works great without needing 9+ perfect photos immediately

**Then upgrade to Option 3** once you have 10-15 high-quality photos ready.
