# Event-Based Display System - Business Owner Guide

## What We Built For You

Your website now has an **intelligent automatic system** that changes the main image and message on your homepage based on what holiday or event is coming up next. Think of it as having a smart assistant who automatically updates your storefront window display for each season and celebration.

---

## Why This Matters For Your Business

### **Before This System:**
- You had to manually change images for each holiday
- Easy to forget to update the website
- Risk of showing outdated content (like Christmas images in February)
- Required technical knowledge to make changes
- Time-consuming maintenance

### **After This System:**
- ✅ **Automatic Updates**: Website changes itself based on the calendar
- ✅ **Always Relevant**: Customers see timely, seasonal content
- ✅ **More Sales**: Right product shown at the right time
- ✅ **Professional Image**: Your website stays fresh and current
- ✅ **Zero Maintenance**: Set it up once, runs forever

---

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

### **The Magic:**

Every time someone visits your website, the system:

1. **Checks today's date**
2. **Looks at what events are coming up** (Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Christmas, etc.)
3. **Automatically shows the image** for the closest upcoming event
4. **Changes the message** to match that event

### **Real-World Example:**

**January 3, 2026 (Today)**
- System checks: "What's the next big event?"
- Valentine's Day is February 14 (42 days away)
- System says: "Too early for Valentine's, show generic birthday/anniversary content"

**January 24, 2026 (21 days before Valentine's)**
- System checks: "What's the next big event?"
- Valentine's Day is now 21 days away
- System says: "Perfect timing! Show Valentine's Day image"
- **Website automatically switches** to Valentine's content
- Message changes to: *"Celebrate love with romantic petal dome arrangements"*

**February 15, 2026 (Day after Valentine's)**
- System checks: "What's the next big event?"
- Easter is coming up in April
- System says: "Valentine's is over, show Easter/Spring content"
- **Website automatically switches** to next event

## What Events Are Set Up

Here's what the system currently handles automatically:

| Event | When It Displays | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Valentine's Day** (Feb 14) | Jan 24 - Feb 14 | 3 weeks before |
| **Easter** (~April 20) | ~April 6 - April 20 | 2 weeks before |
| **Mother's Day** (~May 11) | ~April 27 - May 11 | 2 weeks before |
| **Thanksgiving** (~Nov 28) | ~Nov 7 - Nov 28 | 3 weeks before |
| **Christmas** (Dec 25) | ~Nov 25 - Dec 25 | 1 month before |
| **New Year** (Jan 1) | ~Dec 18 - Jan 1 | 2 weeks before |
| **Generic Events** | Anytime | Year-round |
| (Birthday, Anniversary, Gender Reveal) | (when no specific event is upcoming) | |

## Business Benefits With Real Examples

### **1. Timely Marketing**
**Scenario**: It's January 20. Customers start thinking about Valentine's Day gifts.
- **Your Website**: Already showing Valentine's arrangements (since Jan 24)
- **Competitor**: Still showing Christmas or generic content
- **Result**: You capture early Valentine's shoppers

### **2. Increased Conversion Rates**
**Scenario**: Customer visits your site on May 5 looking for Mother's Day gifts.
- **Your Website**: Automatically showing Mother's Day arrangements
- **Message**: "Honor Mom with beautiful petal dome arrangements"
- **Result**: Customer sees exactly what they're looking for = Higher chance of sale

### **3. Professional Appearance**
**Scenario**: It's December 26 (day after Christmas).
- **Your Website**: Automatically switches to New Year content
- **Competitor**: Still showing "Merry Christmas" messages
- **Result**: You look current, professional, and on top of trends

### **4. Time Savings**
**Before**: You or your team spend 30 minutes every few weeks updating the website
- 30 min × 12 occasions per year = **6 hours per year**

**After**: System does it automatically
- **0 hours per year**
- More time to focus on creating beautiful petal domes!

## When You Might Want to Make Changes

### **Adding New Events**

- Contact your web developer
- Tell them: Date of event, what image to use, when to start showing it
- They'll add it to the system in 5 minutes

### **Changing Timing**
If you want Valentine's content to show earlier/later:
- Contact your web developer
- Tell them: "Show Valentine's 4 weeks before instead of 3 weeks"
- Quick adjustment in the code

### **Updating Images**
When you create new seasonal designs:

- Contact developer to update which image the system uses

## Common Questions From Business Owners

### **Q: What if I want to manually override it for a special sale?**
**A:** Easy! Your developer can temporarily disable the automatic system and set a specific image. When the sale is over, turn it back on.

### **Q: Can customers still see other occasion images?**
**A:** Yes! The automatic system only affects the main hero image at the top. The gallery section below shows ALL your occasion images all the time, including Valentine's, Birthday, Gender Reveal, etc.

### **Q: What happens if we don't have an image for an upcoming event?**
**A:** The system has smart fallbacks:
- Shows a generic event (Birthday/Anniversary)
- OR shows the default Thanksgiving image
- Your website never looks broken!

### **Q: Does this cost money to run?**
**A:** No recurring costs! It's built into your existing website. No subscriptions, no ongoing fees.

### **Q: What if there's a technical problem?**
**A:** The system has error handling:
- If something breaks, it defaults to showing your Thanksgiving image
- Your website keeps working normally
- No customer-facing errors

## Marketing Strategy Ideas

Now that you have this system, here's how to maximize it:

### **1. Email Marketing Sync**

- **Benefit**: Your website and emails match = professional brand consistency

### **2. Social Media Alignment**
- When website switches to Valentine's content → Start Valentine's Instagram posts
- Screenshot your website's Valentine's section → Share on social media
- **Benefit**: Consistent messaging across all channels

### **3. Early Bird Promotions**
- System shows Valentine's 21 days before → Perfect time for "Early Bird Special"
- "Order by Feb 7 for Valentine's delivery - 10% off!"
- **Benefit**: Capture customers before your competitors

### **4. Last-Minute Shoppers**
- System shows event right up until the day → Catch last-minute buyers
